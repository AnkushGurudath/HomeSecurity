# Security Using 3D Sensor

* To secure a place with a help of 3-D depth sensor
* Interfaced Arduino Uno and a camera, and developing code to capture images
* Planning to interface Raspberry Pi and 3D sensor 
* 3D mapping of objects in the space and Define the objects that needs to be secured
* Alerts if any human or animals touches/reaches the given boundary of the objects
